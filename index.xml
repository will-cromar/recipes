      <description>Lentil Chili is my go-to recipe if I&amp;rsquo;m feeding a large group. It&amp;rsquo;s inexpensive, optionally vegan, and very hands-off. I also made this all the time for myself when I was in university &amp;ndash; in addition to being dirt cheap, the leftovers keep and reheat well for 1 to 2 weeks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always made this in my 6 quart Instant Pot, but you could also almost certainly make it in a slow cooker or dutch oven as well if you adjust the cook-time and amount of liquid accordingly.</description>
