Lentil Chili is my go-to recipe if I'm feeding a large group. It's inexpensive, optionally vegan, and very hands-off. I also made this all the time for myself when I was in university -- in addition to being dirt cheap, the leftovers keep and reheat well for 1 to 2 weeks.

I've always made this in my 6 quart Instant Pot, but you could also almost certainly make it in a slow cooker or dutch oven as well if you adjust the cook-time and amount of liquid accordingly.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb green/brown lentils
- 1 large white or yellow onion, diced
- 1 cup (approx) chopped carrots
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small can of green chilis
- 3.5 - 4 cups broth [^1]
- 14.5 oz canned diced tomatoes
- 28 oz canned crushed tomatoes
- Salt to taste [^2]
- 2 tbsp (approx) spices [^3]
- (Optional) one lime

## Directions

1. Heat oil in pressure cooker on the Saute setting. 
1. Add onions and carrots. Saute until onions are translucent and most of the moisture has evaporated.
1. Add garlic and spices, and heat until fragrant.
1. Add canned chilis, if using. Stir for about one minute.
1. Use a small amount of broth and deglaze pan. Then, add canned tomatoes, remaining broth, and salt.
1. Cook on high pressure for 15 minutes. Allow pressure cooker to release naturally for at least 10 minutes before opening.
1. Add lime, correct seasoning, and serve.

## Notes

- Fresh chilis (especially poblanos) also work great -- to use them in place of canned, just add them with the onions.
- Fire-roasted tomatoes can give a deeper tomato flavor.

[^1]: I've used both vegetable and chicken broth here. Obviously, it's only vegan if you use vegatable broth.

[^2]: Soy sauce (approx 1 tbsp) also work well

[^3]: I've recently started using Penzey's Chili 9000 blend with this recipe to save time. Previously, I used a ratio something like this: 1 tbsp chili powder, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander.
